First function for removing data :
Here is my idea. We are not supposed to be "memory pigs" so we should do it in one go.

Calculate the total number of points : num_total = number_lines * number_columns.
Calculate the number of points to remove : num_remove = percentage / 100 * num_total
I found a magic function : random.sample. We can call random.sample(range(num_total),num_remove).
This will create a list with the positions we are going to delete.

Iterate through the file, for each line :
	Find the number of points to remove
	Randomly choose which points to erase (if any)
	Write it in the new file
